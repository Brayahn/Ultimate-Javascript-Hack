 There are many ways to select an element.

    Finding HTML elements by id - The Easiest and the most efficient way to find an element id by id. We can assign some id to an element and can select that element as shown below.
    Finding HTML elements by tag name - consider that for some reasons we want to manipulate all elements of a particular kind . Let's say we want to manipulate all images of our webpage which can be done as shown below.
    Finding HTML elements by class name - Class names are assigned to elements to style them uniquely. lets say to style all links in out website we had assigned some class say "our-link" to them and now we want to manipulate them.
    Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors - css selectors are that you can use any combination of class, id, tag name and many more to select a particular element. we will not go into detail as it itself can be an another topic. For example lets just say that we had given a same class "link" to all our links in web page as well as some span elements also to make them look like a link but now we just want to select all the span elements and not the links.
